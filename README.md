# Explaining the meme
Internet is made of millions of memes flowing everyday, so, devs create a ton of new images showing how their code doesn't work, 
the server is down or even the programming language is broken or annoying. ðŸ¤”

This particular meme comes from Javascript enviroments inside web and application development.
> Javascript lack variable types, so casting, parsing and all that stuff is pretty tough

So someone discovered that using the default **parseInt();** function with a number **0.0000005 returns the 5 as result instead of 0.**

## Ok, but how is that even possible? ðŸ’­
To solve this mistery I make two scripts in **javascript** and **python** that share the same logic.

> Python uses int() to parse so I use it here. But I realized that the function is protected 
> against using a float as an input, showing the following error.

Ok so, thats it, javascript is broken ðŸ”¥ðŸ’” 


## Maybe this is not that simple.
Okay so python is protected. But I solve this issue using **float()** function and now is running:

The output is showing, but using **scientific notation**



## Getting closer to the solution ðŸ’¡

SO! python is using another notation when parsing number is  small enought. **Let's try parsing with parseFloat() in javascript instead.**

> Excellent! The number is shown in the correct way now. BUT IN **SCIENTIFIC NOTATION**

## Okay but what's Javascript doing inside the getInt() function? ðŸ’» 

> That's the funny part, it seems that **javascript is using the parseFloat()** function that 
> returns **5e-7** and then getting the first numbers before the 'ilegal characters' 

We can see this behaivour here with the following snipet:

## The conclusion ðŸ’¬

> Using javascript parseInt() to parse a float inside a String is extremelly incorrect. 
> You MUST be using parseFloat() and then trunc the number if you want.

How amazing is that? 

I hope you enjoy this experiment!ðŸ§ª
